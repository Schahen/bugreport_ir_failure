# About kotlinx-nodejs
This repository contains a source set of kotlin [external declarations](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/js-interop.html) for using nodejs
API for a Kotlin JavaScript target. 

# Current state 
Right now the only thing we guarantee is that the provided source set is compiling. There can be, unfortunately, 
some inconsistent declarations, missing declarations, redundant declarations or even unusable ones.
 
Feel free to create any issues and bug reports and they will be addressed as soon as possible. 
Keep in mind that these sources are generated with [Dukat](https://github.com/Kotlin/dukat) and **are not supposed to be edited manually**.
So it makes not much of a sense to create a PR with suggested improvements but rather to discuss in an issue
what these particular improvements supposed to be.
